Enable seamless logging into Weights & Biases' Weave for easy inspection of function calls in AI applications, with a particular focus on large language model interactions. This unofficial, opinionated package provides a Julia-centric approach that doesn't adhere to the Python Weave API. The goal is to have seamless integration with PromptingTools.jl to enable rapid prototyping and data-driven development.
